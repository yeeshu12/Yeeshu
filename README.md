# Hey, I'm Yeeshu

CS student at Turiba University learning backend development. I build systems with Java and Spring Boot, and I care about writing code that actually makes sense.

Started learning programming a few months ago and realized I like thinking about how things work behind the scenes - databases, APIs, that kind of stuff. Not interested in knowing everything, just want to get really good at backend development.

## What I'm working with

- **Languages:** Java, C#, SQL, Python (basic), JavaScript (basic)
- **Backend:** Spring Boot, REST APIs, CRUD systems
- **Database:** MySQL, SQL queries, designing schemas
- **Tools:** Git, GitHub, Linux, VS Code

## Projects

### Student Management System
Built a backend system for managing student records. Nothing fancy, but it taught me a lot about how real applications are structured.

- REST APIs that actually handle CRUD operations properly
- MySQL database with relationships that make sense
- Controller → Service → Repository pattern (layered architecture)
- Input validation and error handling that feels production-like
- Code that I can come back to and understand

### Multi-Page Responsive Website
A website project I built to understand frontend. Made it responsive, added some JavaScript interactivity. Basic stuff but good practice.

## What I'm learning

Right now focused on:
- Getting better at algorithms and data structures
- Understanding how systems actually scale
- Writing cleaner code
- Making my SQL queries more efficient

## What's next

Looking for a backend development internship. I want to work on real projects, see how professional code looks, and learn from people who actually know what they're doing.

I think it's more important to understand one thing deeply than to know a little bit about everything. That's how I approach learning.
